Windows is Microsoft’s operating system. It’s the most used desktop OS in the world. People use it for gaming, school, work, and everyday tasks. If you’ve ever used a public, school, or office computer, it was most likely running Windows.

Windows connects software with hardware and manages programs, files, drivers, users, and security. Without an operating system like Windows, a computer cannot function.
