Linux

Linux is a free and open-source operating system** based on the Linux kernel, first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

What Linux is used for:

* Servers (websites, cloud, databases)
* Developers and programming
* Cybersecurity and networking
* Embedded systems (routers, smart devices)
* Desktops and laptops (via distributions)

How Linux works:

* Kernel manages hardware (CPU, RAM, disks, drivers)
* Users interact through a desktop environment or terminal
* Software is installed via package managers, not random installers

Key features:

* Open source (anyone can view or modify the code)
* Very stable and secure
* Highly customizable
* Efficient on both old and new hardware
* Strong permission and user system

Linux distributions (distros):

* Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Linux Mint, Kali, etc.
* Each distro packages the same kernel with different tools and desktops

Professional notes:

* Dominates servers and cloud infrastructure
* Preferred for development and automation
* Requires more technical knowledge than Windows for some tasks
* Can coexist with Windows (dual-boot or virtual machines)

Simple summary:

* **Windows** → consumer & business desktops
* **Linux** → servers, development, infrastructure, power users
