## Windows Operating System

**Windows** is Microsoft’s operating system.  
It’s the most used desktop OS on the planet.

If you’ve ever gamed, used school PCs, or touched an office computer — yeah, that was **Windows**.

## What Windows actually does

Windows is the **middleman** between:
- **You** (mouse, keyboard, apps)
- **Hardware** (CPU, GPU, RAM, disks)

It manages:
- **Apps and processes**
- **Files and folders**
- **Drivers** (so hardware actually works)
- **Security, users, and permissions**

Without an operating system, your PC is just a **very expensive brick**.
