Yo skiid right here!
This is my personal repository where I keep all the ISO files I use.

I made this repo to collect everything in one place and share it for free with anyone who needs it.  
No gatekeeping, no paywalls, just ISOs and basic instructions so you actually know what to do with them.

You’ll find different operating system ISOs here, plus some notes on how to use them, install them, or test stuff with them.  
I mostly use these for installs, VMs, testing, and messing around with systems.

This repo is meant to be simple:
- download
- read the notes
- use the ISO
- done

I’ll keep adding more ISOs over time as I use new ones or update old ones.

If something is missing or broken, that’s on me — I’ll fix it eventually 😅  
Feel free to use anything here.

Enjoy.
