# isos, and more! - last update 26 Dec 2025 - Note: im still finishing it.

Yo skiid right here!
This is my personal repository where I keep all the ISO files I use, and more

I made this repo to collect everything in one place and share it for free with anyone who needs it.  
No gatekeeping, no paywalls, just files and  basic instructions so you actually know what to do with them.

if there is anything wrong or you need more files just make a "issue"
